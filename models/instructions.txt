To use your own custom model, rename your model file to realistic (for models with SD v1-5 base) or realisticXL (SDXL v1.0 based) and then place the model folder into this folder. 
Custom LORA weights can be used by replacing the weight.safetensors (for models with SD v1-5 base) or weightsXL((SDXL v1.0 based)) file in this folder with your trained weight.
